            At SeedLit, our mission is to
            <strong>
              {' '}
              transform big ideas into imaginative, age-appropriate narratives{' '}
            </strong>
            that weave meaningful lessons into every story. We aim to inspire
            young minds while fostering curiosity, resilience, and
            leadershipâ€”equipping both children and parents with tools that carry
            through their journey together.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            What started as a simple ideaâ€”creating children's books based on big
            ideas from adult booksâ€”quickly evolved into something more. We
            realized that it wasn't just about the stories themselves but about
            the <strong>conversations they sparked</strong> and the{' '}
            <strong>connections they fostered</strong> between parents and
            children.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            That's when SeedLit became more than just books. It's a{' '}
            <strong>community</strong> for parents who, like me, want to be
            intentional about raising thoughtful, curious, and resilient kids. A
            place where we can share insights, ideas, and support as we navigate
            parenthood together.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            At SeedLit, we believe that learning isn't a one-way street. Parents
            and children grow <strong>together</strong>, and our goal is to
            create resources, discussions, and stories that support that
            journeyâ€”helping to plant seeds of wisdom that will flourish for
            years to come.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The name <strong>SeedLit</strong> is a fusion of multiple ideas:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-6 md:ml-10 mt-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>
              <strong>"Seed"</strong> represents planting ideas, knowledge, and
              curiosity in young minds, just as we nurture seeds to grow into
              something strong and lasting.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"Lit"</strong> is a nod to literature, storytelling, and
              illuminationâ€”sparking curiosity and igniting the imagination.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It's also a play on "seedlet,"</strong> which refers to a
              tiny seedlingâ€”small, but full of potential. Just like the stories
              we create, seedlets hold the promise of something greater, ready
              to grow with the right care and nurturing.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            Together, <strong>SeedLit</strong> represents our belief that
            stories have the power to{' '}
            <strong>plant ideas that grow for a lifetime</strong>â€”not just for
            children, but for the entire family.
