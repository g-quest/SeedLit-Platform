                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  SeedLit was born from a moment of reflectionâ€”one that many new
                  parents experience. As my wife and I prepared to welcome our
                  first child, I found myself thinking about the lessons I
                  wished I had learned earlier in life. I've always turned to
                  books for guidance, but what if we could introduce{' '}
                  <strong>big ideas</strong> to children in a way that was
                  engaging, imaginative, and meaningful from the start?
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
                  That thought sparked the beginning of SeedLit. Many of us
                  weren't handed a roadmap for concepts like resilience,
                  creativity, or emotional intelligence. Instead, we stumbled
                  upon these lessons in our 20s or 30s, often through trial and
                  error. <strong>SeedLit was created to change that</strong>â€”to
                  give kids (and their parents) access to{' '}
                  <strong>timeless wisdom</strong> through beautifully crafted
                  stories that plant seeds of knowledge and curiosity.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              What started as a simple ideaâ€”creating children's books based on
              big ideas from adult booksâ€”quickly evolved into something more. We
              realized that it wasn't just about the stories themselves but
              about the <strong>conversations they sparked</strong> and the{' '}
              <strong>connections they fostered</strong> between parents and
              children.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              That's when SeedLit became more than just books. It's a{' '}
              <strong>community</strong> for parents who, like me, want to be
              intentional about raising thoughtful, curious, and resilient kids.
              A place where we can share insights, ideas, and support as we
              navigate parenthood together.

            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              At SeedLit, we believe that learning isn't a one-way street.
              Parents and children grow <strong>together</strong>, and our goal
              is to create resources, discussions, and stories that support that
              journeyâ€”helping to plant seeds of wisdom that will flourish for
              years to come.

                <strong>"Seed"</strong> represents planting ideas, knowledge,
                and curiosity in young minds, just as we nurture seeds to grow
                into something strong and lasting.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>"Lit"</strong> is a nod to literature, storytelling, and
                illuminationâ€”sparking curiosity and igniting the imagination.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>It's also a play on "seedlet,"</strong> which refers to
                a tiny seedlingâ€”small, but full of potential. Just like the
                stories we create, seedlets hold the promise of something
                greater, ready to grow with the right care and nurturing.
